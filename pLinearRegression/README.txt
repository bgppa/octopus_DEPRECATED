Example of a 1-dimensional linear regression done by using the
bayesian inverse technique.
The user must given the filename as parameter,
which is supposed to be a list of pairs x_i, y_i.

Esample of data set: data.txt

By executing ./main data.txt
the script finds a, b = 1.998, 2.003 with a redisual error
of 0.054%. In output a file posterior_measure.txt is created.
As with every bayesian simulation it contains the samples posterior measure:
a list of:
value_for_a	value_for_b	probability_of_such_a_couple

The number of samples produced in such a way equals the square root of
the samples produced via Monte Carlo, and is generated by using
a k-means clustering algorithm.

This folder contains the compiled object files of my library.
These file themselves are not supposed to be ulpoaded in git
(of course...), but the obj folder is useful in order to 
preserve the hierarchy structure.
It allows the script compile.sh to work directly without any
changes (the object files will be placed here).

Both the Italian and the chinese dataset run for 20 days.

Italy (10 days, subexponential exp(sqrt(alpha * t + beta)):
        res err 3.52%, alpha = 3.34, beta = 5.34

China (10 days, same above):
        res err: 6.5%, alpha = 4.18, beta = 31.5

Italy (20 days, Gompertz)
        res err: 5.31, alpha = 0.095, N = 51600

China (20 days, Gompertz):
        res err: 6.7%, alpha = 0.203, N = 51000

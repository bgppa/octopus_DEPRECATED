The script in this folder check the validity of 10 random tests.

A test is the following procedure:
 - generate random parameters for the model;
 - run the model, observe the results;
 - recontruct the parameters from the result.

When you change model, you should **always** perform a set of test
in order to understand what are the most suitable hyperparameters
for the current case.
